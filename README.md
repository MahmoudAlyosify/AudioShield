# AudioShield

**Voice Integrity. Audio Security.**

AudioShield is an AI-powered tool designed to detect and flag deepfake or tampered audio. It protects users and organizations by verifying the authenticity of audio content.

---

## 🔒 What It Does

- Detects deepfake or synthetic audio using machine learning.
- Flags suspicious segments with a confidence score.
- Visualizes anomalies in audio using spectrograms.
- Provides a simple interface for uploading and analyzing files.

---

## 🛡 Use Cases

- Secure call centers against voice fraud.
- Protect virtual meetings from voice impersonation.
- Prevent identity theft in financial transactions.
- Build trust in digital banking and e-commerce platforms.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Input**: Upload or record audio (WAV, MP3).
2. **Preprocessing**: Normalize, clean, and segment audio.
3. **Feature Extraction**: Extract MFCCs and acoustic patterns.
4. **Detection**: Run the model to classify audio as real or fake.
5. **Output**: Return a confidence score and highlight suspicious parts.
